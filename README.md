# Home Credit
## MSBA Capstone Preperation


### Business Problem
Home Credit is a company that provides loans to individuals with little to no credit history. Their mission is to empower people to live the life they want today. However, giving loans is a high risk business since there is the potential for a client to default on the loan and never repay the funds. Home Credit wants to build a machine learning model that will be able to predict which applicants are likely to default so as to avoid participating in risky lending.

### Group Solution

Our group determined the best model for Home Credit was an XGBoost model using upsampled data. The accuracy was somewhat lower than our other models, but the recall, or the models ability to predict the true defaulters was much higher. Since this is the costlier problem for Home Credit, we recommmend using this model to predict who to lend to. Our group also recommomends taking more time to do more data cleaning and enhanced feature engineering. We feel that this model we built can still be improved on.

### My Contrbution
I contributed to this project in a variety of ways. I explored the data in depth before joining the group in modeling which gave us the background to clean and identify important featurs early on. I spent most of my time with data validation and cleaning and building some basic logistic regression models and analyzing the specific variables significance. These feature explorations helped us build the more complext models.

### Business Value of Solution
The business value derived from the solution is that Home Credit will be able to correctly and confidently identify applicants that default therefore not offer them Home Credit services. This will save Home Credit money because it is more expensive to have a client defualt than it is worthwhile to have the client pay back the loan in full.

### Challenges we faced
The largest challenge we faced was the data itself. It was heavily skewed toward non-defaulters. There were a lot of outliers and missing data. We really struggled with imputation and knowing how we needed to fill in those missing values

### Key Learnings
My biggest takeaway from this practice project is the importance of simply spending time with the data every day. There was so much we could have done and so many ideas we had, but data cleaning and feature engineering takes a lot longer on dirty data than we anticipated. I think it is important to spend time with the data so I can know it better and I can familiarize myself with its issues and immportant features.
