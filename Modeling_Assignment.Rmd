# Task 3

#**WE DID NOT DO THE DEBT TO INCOME OR LOAN AMOUNT/CREDIT SCORE. DO WE WANT TO BEFORE SUNDAY?

#Divide loan amount by credit score
  # it can also scale the loan amounts if we divide it by loan amount (a large loan for someone with a low score might signal higher default)
  
#calculate debt to income ratio

```

# Task 1
**Set up a training set and a validation set using application_train.csv data set to do cross-validation.  Alternatively you could perform cross-validation using a different framework, such as k-fold cross validation as implemented in modeling packages such as caret or tidymodels or scikit-learn. The model performance that matters, of course, is the estimated performance on the test set as well as the Kaggle score.**

```{r}
set.seed(123)

#keep at 10% because the data set is large
inTrain <- createDataPartition(App_train$TARGET, p = .1, list = FALSE)


train_set <- App_train[inTrain,]
test_set <- App_train[-inTrain,]

test_target <- App_train[-inTrain,2]


```


# Task 2
**Identify the performance benchmark established by the majority class classifier.**

```{r}
prop.table(table(App_train$'TARGET'))
```


If we just went off the majority classifier to predict if someone would default, they would not 91.92% of the time. The performance benchmark is 91.92%.

# Task 3
**Fit several different logistic regression models using different predictors. Do interaction terms improve the model?  Compare model performance using not just accuracy but also AUC.**

```{r}
glmModel1 <- glm(TARGET~ 1, family = binomial, data = train_set)

summary(glmModel1)
```

```{r}
prob <- exp(coef(glmModel1)[1]) / (1 + exp(coef(glmModel1)[1]))
prob
```


The odds of the target being one are 0.079. The negative intercept shows that there are low likelihood of the target being 1

```{r}

predictions1 <- predict(glmModel1, newdata = test_set, type = "response")
summary(predictions1)

##All thses are returning null???
mmetric(test_target, predictions1, metric = c("ACC"))

```
Just using the target gets us to 91.93

```{r}
glmModel2 <- glm(TARGET~Age + EXT_SOURCE_1 + EXT_SOURCE_2 +  EXT_SOURCE_3 + AMT_INCOME_TOTAL + CNT_CHILDREN + DAYS_EMPLOYED + AMT_CREDIT + AMT_ANNUITY, family = binomial, data = train_set)

summary(glmModel2)
```
The older you get the less likely you are to default

Total income is not significant in this model.

All these effects have a low impact

```{r}
predictions2 <- predict(glmModel2, newdata = test_set, type = "response")
summary(predictions2)


predictions2 <- ifelse(predictions2>0.5,1,0)
confusionMatrix(factor(predictions2),factor(test_target))
```
The accuracy increased to 92.74. 

```{r}
#adding two interaction terms
#1 - age*amt_income
#2amt_income* cnt_children (not family members to stay consistent with the above)
glmModel3 <- glm(TARGET~ EXT_SOURCE_1 + EXT_SOURCE_2 + EXT_SOURCE_3 + Age*AMT_INCOME_TOTAL + AMT_INCOME_TOTAL*CNT_CHILDREN + DAYS_EMPLOYED + AMT_CREDIT + AMT_ANNUITY, family = binomial, data = train_set)

summary(glmModel3)
```
Interaction terms are not significant. The terms are not really significant on their own.



```{r}
predictions3 <- predict(glmModel3, newdata = test_set, type = "response")
summary(predictions3)


predictions3 <- ifelse(predictions3>0.5,1,0)
confusionMatrix(factor(predictions3),factor(test_target))
```
accuracy increases to 92.75, which is not much better. The interaction terms are not significant predictors on their own. So accuracy might be going up because there are more predictors and R2 is going up and therefore the model is overfitting.

Predicting a lot more true positive. Accuracy is lower overall though. We might want this over higher accuracy though because the true postives are costly and what we want to identify.

SVM models do not perform very well on highly correlated data, as our data includes highly correlated terms, the SVM model may not perform well. 

```{r}

corr_matrix <- cor(numeric_train_no_missing, use = "complete.obs")


corr_table <-as.data.frame(as.table(corr_matrix))

ggplot(train_data_SVM, aes(x = AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, y = AMT_CREDIT, color = TARGET)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Income vs Credit", x = "AMT_INCOME_TOTAL", y = "AMT_CREDIT") +
  theme_minimal()

# days employed vs Credit Score

# days employed is a negative value to indicate the number of days back from the application date one was employed
train_data_SVM$DAYS_EMPLOYED <- abs(train_data_SVM$DAYS_EMPLOYED) # fix the negatives by taking absolute value

ggplot(train_data_SVM, aes(x = DAYS_EMPLOYED, y = EXT_SOURCE_2, color = TARGET)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Days emplopyed vs Credit Score", x = "DAYS_EMPLOYED", y = "EXT_SOURCE_2") +
  theme_minimal()
```

These plots indicate that there is not a large amount of linear separability in the data, this means that a linear SVM model may not be the best route, and we should explore the performance of a radial model.

# Apply scaling to both the training and test encoded features

```

Using dummies_train for both train_features and test_features ensures that the dummy variables are consistent across both datasets.

```

model is not producing any true positives, it suggests that it might be overly biased toward predicting the negative class. This could happen due to class imbalance, poor hyper-parameter tuning, or the model simply not finding enough distinguishing features for the positive class. 

We could look at running the model on the upsampled data, or just sticking with improving the RandomForest model, as those models tend to handle class imbalance and outliers better.

# Task 6 
**Experiment with upsampling and downsampling the data to adjust for the imbalanced target variable.  (See APM Ch. 16.)  Does this strategy this improve model performance?**

```{r}

levels(predicted_class_with_features_upsampled)

Accuracy has not improved on the logistic model with features for the upsampled data

```

```{r}
rfModelUPPreds <- predict(rfModelUP, newdata = test_set, type = "response")

summary(rfModelUPPreds)

confusionMatrix(rfModelUPPreds,factor(test_target))
```
Accuracy actually went down for random forest on the upsampled data. barely better than the majority class.


We do not want to downsample this dataset since there are already so few default observations.

# Task 7
**Try combining model predictions--this is called an ensemble model--to improve performance.**

The assemble model showed a slight improvement with an accuracy of 92.7%. Similar to the other models, sensitivity was high across the board with all models effectively identifying non-default cases. Specificity continued to be low for the ensemble model making it difficult to identify default cases. Overall the ensemble model slightly outperforms the other models.  


```{r}
# Generate binary predictions from glmModelUP
glm_binary <- ifelse(predictions2 > 0.5, 1, 0)


# Convert rfModel1Preds to numeric if it's a factor of binary predictions
rf_binary <- as.numeric(as.character(rfModel2Preds))


# Re-calculate ensemble predictions using valid glm_binary and rf_binary
ensemble_preds <- as.integer(glm_binary + rf_binary >= 1)
ensemble_preds <- factor(ensemble_preds, levels = c(0, 1))


# Run confusion matrix to evaluate ensemble model
confusionMatrix(ensemble_preds, test_target)


```
  


# Task 8
**Try additional feature engineering to boost model performance. Can you combine variables or bin numeric variables?  Explore the notebooks at Kaggle for data transformation ideas. In particular, use the other data sets at Kaggle--beyond the application data--to create additional features.**

The feature-engineered model again showed a slight improvement compared to previous models with an accuracy of 0.9275%. It effectively identifies non-default cases, but specificity is still low so it isn't great for detecting defaults.
